Modeled truck-drone hybrid delivery system, to recommend best route using XpressMP 


**Problem Statement**

A transportation company is evaluating a prototype system that combines trucks and drones for last-mile delivery services. The test run considers a set of orders that must be delivered to known locations. A delivery truck starts from a depot and visits “launch sites” corresponding to the customers locations. From each launch site, the truck deploys a series of drones that deliver the orders and return to meet the truck at the launch site. Once all the drones are recovered, the truck moves to the next launch site and repeats the process until all orders are delivered.
