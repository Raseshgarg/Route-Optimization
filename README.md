# Route-Optimization
Modeled truck-drone hybrid delivery system, to recommend best route using XpressMP (Optimisation software)

**Problem Statement**

A transportation company is evaluating a prototype system that combines trucks and drones for last-mile delivery services. The test run considers a set of orders that must be delivered to known locations. A delivery truck starts from a depot and visits “launch sites” corresponding to the customers locations. From each launch site, the truck deploys a series of drones that deliver the orders and return to meet the truck at the launch site. Once all the drones are recovered, the truck moves to the next launch site and repeats the process until all orders are delivered.

For each unit of distance traveled by the truck there is a cost of $10, while for each unit of distance traveled by a drone there is a cost of $3. Our objective is to minimize the total travel cost (both by the trucks and the drones).

**Softwares used** Microsoft Excel (for generating Inputs), XpressMP (for optimizing), Python (for generating graphs)
